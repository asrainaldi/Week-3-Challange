## Week-3-Challange

### What was the challange
Write a class with a method inside that takes in an Integer for a value between 1 - 999. The method should take the number and convert it to the corresponding number in plain english. E.g. If the method takes the parameter 73, it will return the value "Seventy three".
**Stretch Goals**
Increase the range from 1 - 9999.
**Submission**
You should create a public Github repository that contains the code for the above task.
You are also expected to make a README.md file and to fill this README with information of this challenge. It should contain the following headers.

## How I expected the challange to go
Fairly stright forward

## What went well?
Produced the ebd result in a timley manner

## What didn't go as planned?
The inital design I used went from smallest to biggest number division,  which made it overall complex. After dissussion with others, I re-wrote it to go from biggest number to smallest.

## Possible improments for fucture challenges.
Perhaps mid week group challanges might help the group overall.
